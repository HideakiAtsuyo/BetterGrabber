# FIX
- [x] 25/25 Stars(Ready) = FIX (actually not working anymore, they took more time that I thought but at least they finally patched it :))
- [ ] 40/45 Stars(Actually Ready To Be Posted) = Post The Builder & Stub, Source Code in [Injector Branch](https://github.com/HideakiAtsuyo/BetterGrabber/tree/injector) & Release in [Releases](https://github.com/HideakiAtsuyo/BetterGrabber/releases) (It will make the plugin work again and remove Better Discord Securities.)

# Known Issues
- Streamer Mode Enabled => Discriminator hidden(should add an auto-disable stream mode)
